Look for patterns in the .clinerules file related to FinBERT models and Gemma 3 implementations, particularly the 5-class sentiment classification. 

New patterns to document:
1. Gemma 3 model uses LoRA fine-tuning similar to Gamma 3 with r=8, alpha=16
2. All model implementations follow consistent notebook structure for better comparison
3. All models implement multi-metric early stopping for improved quality
4. The 5-class sentiment system is now standardized across all model implementations
5. All models are trained with similar hyperparameters for fair comparison
6. The naming convention for notebooks is consistent with 02a_ prefix for main model implementations

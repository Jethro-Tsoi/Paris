## Current Status

The project has successfully implemented both 3-class and 5-class sentiment classification models using FinBERT. The 5-class model extends the original implementation to provide more granular sentiment analysis with STRONGLY_NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE, and STRONGLY_POSITIVE classifications.

The FinBERT 5-class training notebook has been created and tested, with appropriate modifications to handle the expanded label set. Key changes include:
- Updated label mapping for 5 sentiment classes
- Modified model initialization for 5-class output
- Adapted confusion matrix visualization
- Implemented label mapping serialization
- Changed output directory to '../models/finbert_5labels'

The training process uses the same hyperparameters as the 3-class model for fair comparison, with early stopping based on validation metrics. Both models can now coexist in the project, allowing for comparative analysis of performance and use cases.

Next steps include completing the evaluation of the 5-class model performance, integrating it into the web interface, and potentially extending the approach to other model architectures like Gemma 3.

## Known Issues

- GPU memory constraints for larger models
- API rate limits for large-scale data labeling
- Ensuring consistent performance across different environments
- Balancing granularity of sentiment classes with prediction accuracy
- Standardizing evaluation metrics for fair model comparison

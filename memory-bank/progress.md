## Current Status

The project has recently expanded to include a backtesting framework for evaluating FinBERT sentiment predictions in potential trading strategies. The backtesting script (`final_backtest.py`) processes sentiment predictions from the FinBERT model, extracts ticker symbols, fetches historical price data using yfinance, and simulates trades based on sentiment signals.

Key achievements in the backtesting implementation:
1. Successfully processed 28,176 rows from the FinBERT predictions CSV
2. Extracted 2,890 unique ticker symbols from financial_info data
3. Implemented a trading strategy that generates trades for each sentiment signal
4. Developed visualization components for backtest results including:
   - Average returns and win rates by ticker
   - Individual ticker analysis charts
   - Returns by sentiment type
   - Trade counts by sentiment
5. Fixed issues with individual ticker analysis charts
6. Enhanced timestamp parsing to handle different formats
7. Implemented robust ticker handling with proper error management

The script now generates detailed statistics for each ticker, including period return, max drawdown, average daily return, return variance, trade performance metrics (average return, win rate, max gain/loss), and sentiment breakdown.

The project PARIS (Personalized AI-Advisor for Robo Investment Strategies) has successfully implemented all planned model architectures including both 3-class and 5-class sentiment classification models using FinBERT, as well as LoRA fine-tuning for Gamma 3 and Gemma 3. The 5-class models extend the original implementation to provide more granular sentiment analysis with STRONGLY_NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE, and STRONGLY_POSITIVE classifications.

The Gemma 3 implementation with LoRA fine-tuning has been completed in 02a_gemma3_training_lora.ipynb, adding another powerful model architecture to compare with FinBERT and Gamma 3. All models are now implemented with consistent evaluation metrics and early stopping mechanisms.

A comprehensive model comparison between Gemma 3 and FinBERT has been implemented in 03_model_comparison.ipynb, evaluating both models on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient, ROC-AUC score, and inference speed. The comparison includes visualizations like bar charts for metrics and confusion matrices for detailed analysis.

Additionally, a new notebook 04_finbert_predictions.ipynb has been created to generate predictions on the full all_labeled_tweets.csv dataset using the fine-tuned FinBERT model. This notebook implements efficient batch processing for large datasets, adds detailed analysis of prediction distributions, compares predictions with original labels when available, and uses timestamp-based file naming for prediction outputs.

The training process uses similar hyperparameters across models for fair comparison, with early stopping based on validation metrics. All models can coexist in the project, allowing for comparative analysis of performance and use cases.

The project now has comprehensive documentation in the form of a detailed README.md in both the project root and notebooks directory, outlining the project setup, notebook execution order, descriptions of each notebook, output files generated, model artifacts structure, and required dependencies. The documentation provides clear instructions for running the notebooks in the correct sequence to reproduce the entire pipeline from data processing to model training. Common issues and their fixes have also been documented, including Gemma 3 AttributeError and FinBERT column mismatch fixes.

Next steps include completing a comprehensive evaluation of all model architectures, integrating them into the web interface, and analyzing their performance differences.

## Development Environment

The project uses Docker and Docker Compose for a containerized development environment with the following services:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Jupyter Notebooks: http://localhost:8888

A comprehensive Makefile provides standardized commands for development:
```bash
make help      # Show all available commands
make up        # Start all services
make down      # Stop all services
make build     # Build/rebuild services
make dev       # Start with development tools
make clean     # Remove all containers and volumes
make logs      # View service logs
make jupyter   # Start Jupyter notebook server
make test-backend  # Run backend tests
make test-frontend # Run frontend tests
```

## Notebook Execution Flow

The project follows a structured notebook execution order for reproducible results:

1. `00b_ner_stock_identification.ipynb` - NER and stock symbol identification
2. `00_data_labeling_with_resume.ipynb` - Primary data labeling with resume capability
3. `00c_data_labeling_with_stocks.ipynb` - Optional stock-focused labeling
4. `00_data_labeling.ipynb` - Optional original data labeling 
5. `01_data_preparation.ipynb` - Data preparation for model training
6. `02a_gemma3_training_lora.ipynb` - Gemma 3 model training
7. `02b_finbert_training.ipynb` - FinBERT model training (both variants)
8. `03_model_comparison.ipynb` - Compare Gemma 3 and FinBERT performance
9. `04_finbert_predictions.ipynb` - Generate predictions on the full dataset

## Known Issues and Fixes

### Gemma 3 AttributeError Fix
When working with Gemma 3 models, you may encounter:
```python
AttributeError: 'Gemma3Config' object has no attribute 'hidden_size'
```

Solution: Modify the code to check for multiple attribute names:
```python
if hasattr(base_model.config, "model_dim"):
    hidden_dim = base_model.config.model_dim
elif hasattr(base_model.config, "hidden_size"):
    hidden_dim = base_model.config.hidden_size
else:
    # Default value for Gemma 3 models (4B model typically uses 4096)
    hidden_dim = 4096
```

### FinBERT Column Mismatch Fix
The FinBERT training notebook may expect columns `text` and `label`, but the dataset has `description` and `sentiment` columns.

Solutions:
1. Use the standalone Python script `finbert_training.py`
2. Modify the notebook to map columns appropriately
3. Use the automated fix script `fix_finbert_notebook.py`

### Other Known Issues
- GPU memory constraints for larger models
- API rate limits for large-scale data labeling
- Ensuring consistent performance across different environments
- Balancing granularity of sentiment classes with prediction accuracy
- Standardizing evaluation metrics for fair model comparison

## Output Files and Model Artifacts

The project generates several key output files in the data directory:
- Tweet datasets with NER results and verified stock symbols
- Labeled tweets with sentiment classifications
- Progress tracking files for resume capability
- Training datasets for different model architectures
- Prediction outputs from the FinBERT model on the full dataset (finbert_predictions_*.csv)

Model artifacts are saved in the models directory with separate subdirectories for different model architectures:
- Gemma 3 model with LoRA adapter weights
- FinBERT models for both 3-class and 5-class sentiment analysis
- Training history and evaluation metrics

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete comprehensive model comparison across all architectures (ETA: 1 week)
2. Complete 5-class model evaluation (ETA: 1 week)
3. Integrate models into web API (ETA: 2 weeks)
4. Develop frontend components for model selection and visualization (ETA: 3 weeks)
5. Comprehensive model comparison and documentation (ETA: 4 weeks)

```

Key directories and their purposes:

1. **notebooks/** - Contains all Jupyter notebooks for the sentiment analysis pipeline, organized by execution order
2. **models/** - Stores trained model artifacts with dedicated subdirectories for each model architecture
3. **scraper/** - Contains Twitter data scraping tools, API integration, and crawler configuration
4. **src/** - Houses core Python modules including data processors and evaluation tools
5. **web/** - Contains the web application with separate backend and frontend directories

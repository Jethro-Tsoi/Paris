## Current Status

The project has successfully implemented all planned model architectures including both 3-class and 5-class sentiment classification models using FinBERT, as well as LoRA fine-tuning for Gamma 3 and Gemma 3. The 5-class models extend the original implementation to provide more granular sentiment analysis with STRONGLY_NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE, and STRONGLY_POSITIVE classifications.

The Gemma 3 implementation with LoRA fine-tuning has been completed in 02a_gemma3_training_lora.ipynb, adding another powerful model architecture to compare with FinBERT and Gamma 3. All models are now implemented with consistent evaluation metrics and early stopping mechanisms.

The training process uses similar hyperparameters across models for fair comparison, with early stopping based on validation metrics. All models can coexist in the project, allowing for comparative analysis of performance and use cases.

Next steps include completing a comprehensive evaluation of all model architectures, integrating them into the web interface, and analyzing their performance differences.

## Known Issues

- GPU memory constraints for larger models
- API rate limits for large-scale data labeling
- Ensuring consistent performance across different environments
- Balancing granularity of sentiment classes with prediction accuracy
- Standardizing evaluation metrics for fair model comparison
